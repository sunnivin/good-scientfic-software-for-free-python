# Pre-commit hooks with Python

This repo contains an example set-up for using pre-commit hooks with your python environment.

The file `.pre-commit-config.yaml` controls the type of pre-commit you are currently using. There exists [several](https://towardsdatascience.com/pre-commit-hooks-you-must-know-ff247f5feb7e) ways to do automatic formatting with Python. This is just an example.

## Usage
Activate the virtual environment

    sunnivin@NGI-R910LQ9W:~/NGI/pre-commit(main)$ pipenv shell

You can run `pre-commit` on all files with the command

    (pre-commit) sunnivin@NGI-R910LQ9W:~/NGI/pre-commit(main)$ pre-commit run --all-files
